								<h4>Business Problem</h4>
								<p>I decided to conduct a before-and-after assessment of a production improvement and communicate if the effort was effective.</p>
								<h4>Method</h4> 
								<p>
    								I used SQL to find defects and Tableau to visualize, analyze, and communicate any effect on our defect count.
								</p>
                    			 <h4>Business Outcome</h4>
                                     <p>I discovered and communicated to the business that, yes, the originator did have a positive return on investment. 
                                </p>   
                                 <h4>How</h4>   	
                         		
							<ol>
                    							<li>I received a documentation change request from a manufacturing engineering looking to revise a manufacturing work instruction. Looks like the incorrect installation of biopsy sensors had caused a sharp increase in defects. 
                        							My Configuration Management training taught me that <b>clear, concise, and valid requirements help reduce corrective action and intervention resources</b>, so I thought, <i>"Thank you, David, for updating these work instructions!"</i>  
                            						<br>But then my data analyst mind thought <i>"Wait...we can measure this"</i>.
                    							</li>
												<img src="../images/Biopsy Guide Failure 1.PNG" />
												<li>I gathered some data using SQL to query the Datasweep Manufacturing Execution System (MES) and retrieve the results of the recent biopsy guide installation failures. I validated the results and optimized the query as best I could.  
												<li>After three months, it was finally time to examine the post-improvements results.  Back to the database to get the final results set.<br>  I loaded the data in Tableau to visualize the results.  Sure enough, there was a 75% reduction in defects after the new work instructions went live. 
												I added a four-week moving average to demonstrate the decrease.  Finally, I emailed the results to the original manufacturing engineer. <b> Exactly the kind of effort I knew we needed to celebrate!</b></li>
												<img src="../images/Biopsy Guide Failure 2.PNG" class="image clickable" style="width:1000px !important;height:auto; !important;" />
												<li>One week went by and I thought to myself, <i>"Wait a minute...there are more insights I can draw from the data. </i>
												 <i>What counter-arguments might someone make about the data?  How else can I interpret the results?"</i>  So I went back to the visualization and database and communicated some new insights to the manufacturing engineer and the business.
												<br>
    												<ul class="alt" style="margin-left:60px">
    												<li></li>
    												<li>How many other units did not have the defect? Maybe we built fewer total units during that time?<br><b> My response: No, the number of units did not result in a change in defects. (Pearson correlation is 0.274, which is below the critical threshold of 0.388 for statistical significance)</b></li>
    												<img class="image clickable" src="../images/Biopsy Guide Failure 5.png" style="width:600px !important;height:auto; !important;" />
    												<li>How did manufacturing overlook the increase in January?<br><b>My response: I reviewed the daily chart and saw that the increase does not appear as dramatic as the weekly chart.  Perhaps an easy miss.</b></li>
    												<img class="image clickable" src="../images/Biopsy Guide Failure 4.png" style="width:600px !important;height:auto; !important;" />
    												<li>How did the percentiles change over time? <br> <b>My response: Using a Gaussian Process Regression model in Tableau, I noticed how the 90th and 10th percentile bands narrowed going into and after the documentation change request.  
    												This shows how much more manageable the Biopsy Guide failures are after the updates compared to before. </b></li>
