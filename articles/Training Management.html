								<h4>Crane Aerospace & Electronics - Launching Convergence Learning Management System</h4>
								<p>I launched Convergence Learning Management System (LMS), now Vector LMS, and was the primary training coordinator and project manager. 
								There, I had minimal training on how to make training and learning effective, so I taught myself. I used the insight gained from talking with coworkers complaining about boring, compliance-driven training to develop a training program with more pre-established learning objectives and assessments.</p>
    							<h4>Fujifilm Sonosite - Launching ComplianceWire Learning Management System</h4>
    							<p>I helped launch the ComplianceWire Learning Management System.  I gathered data for the primary project manager and developed the program that pushes document attributes and attachments to the LMS.
    							  I also participated in a five-day, small-group training workshop specific for Fujifilm Sonosite, learning LMS governance and advanced training management from an industry expert. Through the workshop, we created these strategic vision and mission statements.  </p>
											
									<blockquote>	Vision:  FUJIFILM Sonosite creates a system where motivated employees learn and grow through effective education while remaining compliant to regulations, maintaining a high-performance culture, and contributing to business objectives.  
                                    <br><br>Mission: To get there, employee training must remain relevant, owned, open, and makes sense for associates while minimizing cost and risk.  We created this Mission and Vision statement.						</blockquote>		
								<h4>Electronic Document Management System Feed File</h4>
								<p>During the implementation of ComplianceWire LMS, I was primarily responsible for the feed file that would update the LMS with our new and updated documents for training.  
								I knew I wanted something better than what a programmer created for me back at Crane Aerospace & Electronics and I knew more of the capabilities.
								The new requirements included pushing document attributes and the PDF or Word document to an SFTP transfer site.  I first experimented with teaching myself Batch file programming and XLM transformation until teaching myself and developing a version in PowerShell.  
								Eventually, I discovered it was easier to use the Agile Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) system Java-based event scripting instead as I could utilize the necessary database query and SFTP connection packages instead in a single program.  
								<br><br>So, in the end, I developed a SQL query in the PLM database to retrieve document attributes for recently released documents and the respective PDF/DOC documents over to the SFTP connection.  The Java-based program queries the database and writes the results in a text file needed for ComplianceWire LMS.  
								Then the program used Java.io.InputStream to copy the file over to a folder on the SFTP site.  If there were any errors, I wrote the program to send an email formatted using HTML and CSS with error information to selected individuals.  </p>
                                 <img class="image clickable" src="../images/ComplianceWire capture 2.PNG" alt="Feed File Created as a new TXT File on each run."  style="max-width:400px"/>  
                                         								<h4>FUJIFILM Sonosite - Creating e-Learning</h4>			
								<p>In Winter 2021, I created and launched an approximately two-hour, six-module e-Learning compute-based training using UL Creates.  I chunked the learning content into 10-30 minutes modules, depending on learner speed, and tailored learning objectives 
								and end-of-module evaluations as appropriate.  We assigned modules by need, so not everyone receives the same training.
    				 <h4>Best Practices I utilized</h4>
        							<ul>
										<li>Adult Learning Principles</li>
										<li>Cognitive Load Principles</li>
										<li>Specifically Assigning Modules to Users Based on Needs</li>
										<li>Screenshots and Optional Video Demonstrations</li>
										<li>Transfer of Learning Concepts and Practices</li>
									</ul>
