								<h4>Business Problem</h4>
								<p>What is the relationship between components that skip receiving inspection and end-item quality? </p>
								<h4>Method</h4> 
								<p>
    								This is an ongoing project that has gone through multiple iterations. 
    								I used SQL to simultaneously query multiple databases, using a hierarchical subquery to find components that skipped receiving inspection and return the associated end-item defects.  
    								After noticing significant drawbacks in query performance, I reorganized the query with a top-down hierarchical approach to support reproducibility.  
    								
    								
								</p>
                    			 <h4>Business Outcome</h4>
                                     <p>So far, the results are inconclusive because most of our end items contain parts that skipped receiving inspection. Therefore, many sample datasets matched the population datasets, meaning we could not conduct hypothesis testing with the current analysis level.
                                </p>                            
                                 <h4>How</h4>   	
                         		
                							<ol>
                    							<li>I began by exploring the Datasweep Manufacturing Execution System (MES), an Oracle database, to determine which components skipped receiving inspection. Parts may be allowed to skip receiving inspection based on our company's judgment of a supplier's performance, for instance.
                                				  I continued to query the database for end-item defects and consumption information. 
                                				 <i>However, there was a problem.</i>  I could see which parts skipped receiving inspection and the subassemblies consumed in our end items but not how the sub-components linked with the sub-assemblies within the Datasweep MES database.
                                				
                    							</li>
                    							<li>
                        							For this information, I would have to query for Bill of Material (BOM) data from our Agile Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) system database, an Oracle database.  
                        							This time, I used a BOM explosion query I had previously developed with a database link to the Datasweep MES database.  I used multiple LEFT OUTER JOINs from one database to the other.

                    							Yet again, there was another issue:  This query would never finish!  It consumed too much memory to return the final results set.  So I decided to try something different and program the query in Java to control execution.
                    							The result set took two to three hours to complete.  Looking at the Oracle execution plan, I could tell the query itself was not significant (only a few million disk reads) but time-consuming due to the iterative use of the database link.

												I then queried and added the total number of defects to Tableau as the “population” dataset with the sample items that had components that skipped receiving inspection as the “sample” dataset. Right away, we could generate some insights, namely how various part types, suppliers, and failure codes differed between the sample and population datasets.  
												I used Tableau’s Level of Detail (LOD) to fix the calculations while moving between different levels of granularity.

                                                The analysis did not yet appear complete, however.  With a sample size of over about 13,000 rows and a population size of 14,500, I knew I was not getting the most comprehensive dataset to work with.  The extensive time required to run the query did not seem ideal as well.  So, I decided to take a step back, reset, and try the query again.  This time, I decided to conduct a top-down approach.  
                                                So instead of moving up the chain of “skipped-receiving inspection” components to parent level defects, I queried for parent level defects and moved down to any BOM components that skipped receiving inspection – now a new sample dataset to compare again against all defects.  
                                                This restructured query now took about 15 seconds.

											Now, it was back to Tableau. I added the two datasets and generated some new visualizations. Unfortunately, I was still unable to generate any significant findings with the current set. For example, the “Assembly Array” category represents 45,370 end-item units built compared to 47,400 in the population set. The analysis is inconclusive because almost every Assembly Array at the company contained parts that skipped receiving inspection.

								<h4>Future Outcome</h4>
								<p>In the next couple of months, I will analyze another query iteration of the single BOM level to visualize and test for significant variation between sample and population datasets.
